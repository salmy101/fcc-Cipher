### String Manipualtion to build a Ciper w/ freeCodeCamp

- strings use a zero-based indexing
- to go backwards you can access index [-1] and [-2] and so on
- You can access the number of characters in a string with the built-in len() function.
- Another useful built-in function is type(), which returns the data type of a variable.
- the .find() method to find the position in the alphabet of each letter in your message. A method is similar to a function, but it belongs to an object. will return the index of the first occurrence of whaterver character or word you are trying to find in a string. If .find() method returns a -1, then it was not found
